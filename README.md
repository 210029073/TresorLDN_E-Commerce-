## Some Notice for this Branch
If you wish to make changes to the code, I would suggest **cloning**, or **pulling** from the repository, and switching to **develop** branch when using git.
- The main branch provides the code similar to develop but website is in "working" state.
- The develop branch provides the code that is in "development" state, meaning there is potential risks for bugs, or crashes.
- For Project Group 23, we will be using the develop branch, not main branch.
- The skeleton branch should be avoided.
- Tested Branch will be created soon.
